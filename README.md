# Catbook

This is a Facebook-like application, made with Ruby on Rails.

Catbook is an exercise from the online online bootcamp 'The Odin Project'.
It's the final project that closes the Rails course.

Instructions can be found here :

It was meant to use everything learnt in the "Rails chapter" : From Log-in and authentication to data modelling and advanced forms.

Every core features of Facebook are present : users, profiles, “friending”, posts, news feed, and “liking”.

Besides, the project has the real Facebook sign-in option by using Omniauth and Devise.

It was the first time for me to try 'Devise' gem, and after having implemented sign-in and authentication systems by hand, I really appreciated to use it !
